#!/bin/sh
# Entrypoint for the slopyphus UI/front container (Dockerfile.nginx).
#
# Composes one desktop of agents out of two things only: the templates in $TEMPLATE_DIR and the
# environment. Nothing is hardcoded here, so a single front image can present any number of agents in
# any arrangement.
#
# COLUMNS / ROWS
#   Comma separated "name=url" pairs. The name is what the UI calls the agent; it becomes the iframe's
#   path (/name/), the nginx location that proxies it, and the label in the corner of the pane.
#   The url is the upstream that location proxies to. It may be written at several levels of detail:
#     coder-1                                  -> http://coder-1:7681, upstream path /coder-1
#     coder-1=coder-1:7681                     -> the same, spelled out
#     coder-1=http://other-host:7681           -> a slopyphus agent under a different name
#     alice=https://agent.dev.initialed85.cc/coder-1
#                                            -> any origin; the path is the upstream base path
#     google=https://www.google.com            -> any origin served at its own root
#   Rules: no scheme means a slopyphus agent container (port $AGENT_PORT, and ttyd's base path is the
#   agent's name, which is the first label of the host: coordinator.slopyphus.svc.cluster.local is still
#   an agent called coordinator); a scheme means an arbitrary origin served at whatever path it names
#   (its own root if none).
#   An upstream whose port is $AGENT_PORT is treated as a slopyphus agent either way, so
#   "http://coder-1:7681" and "coder-1" mean the same thing.
#
# LAYOUT
#   columns_left | columns_right  columns are equal, full-height strips on the named side; rows are
#                                 equal, half-width bands filling the other half
#   rows_top | rows_bottom        rows are equal, full-width bands on the named side; columns are
#                                 equal, half-height strips filling the other half
#
# Other environment
#   AGENT_PORT   slopyphus/ttyd port, assumed when a bare host is given        (default 7681)
#   PAGE_TITLE   the browser tab title                                         (default slophyphus)
#   RESOLVER     DNS server for per-request upstream resolution; auto-detected from
#                /etc/resolv.conf, or set to off to resolve every upstream when nginx starts
#   SVC_SUFFIX   appended to bare hosts when looking them up, for Kubernetes: nginx does not expand
#                search domains, so "coordinator" needs SVC_SUFFIX=<namespace>.svc.cluster.local to
#                become a name CoreDNS will answer (default empty)
#   TEMPLATE_DIR / CONF_OUT / HTML_OUT   where the templates are and where they are rendered to
#
# Rendering is deliberately done at container start rather than at build time: the point is to compose
# a desktop from a Deployment's environment without rebuilding an image per desktop. The output is
# plain nginx.conf / index.html, so a crashed container is debuggable by reading two files.
#
# Written for /bin/sh as busybox ash (nginx:alpine has no bash): no arrays, no [[ ]], no $''.
